        <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
        <p>
          Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
          Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can 
          be opened, and a private deck.

        <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
        <p>
          Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed 
          with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, 
          microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes
          a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities
          are located in the lodge.

        <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
        <p>
          Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress 
          for changing weather with light layers of clothing. 
          It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
